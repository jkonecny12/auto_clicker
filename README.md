Autoclicker
===========

This is a tool I'm using to make manual labor a smart labor.

It's pretty easy to use and modify this tool. This tool has two modes. One to store position and save them permanently on disk and second to repeat them plenty of times for you.

How to use
------------

1)

Call `./neighbor store` it will tell you to put mouse pointer to a specified position and press enter.

2)

Call `./neighbor support` or `./neighbor pub` to start the sequence.
